# Technical test for the Junior Data Scientist position at Datrik Intelligence

This repo contains the R and Python code written to:

1.- Perform an **E**xploratory **D**ata **A**nalysis of the provided dataset. This is available in the `EDA.R` R file.

2.- Build linear and gradient boosting models. This is available in the jupyter notebook `models.ipynb`.

3.- Produce a comprehensive documentation of the process, produced automatically by joining the Latex code in `report.Rnw` with the code in `EDA.R` R script.

Directory structure:

* `plots` saves plots produced by R and Python
* `RData`saves R objects to save computation power
* `proc_data` contains the processed dataset at different stages.
* `tables` stores tables produced by R/Python and shown in the report.
